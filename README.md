hello-world
My first repo on Github.

I am beginning on the road to competency with web development.  Up to this point I have only done a few things, but those were very enjoyable and I feel that I need to pursue this path.

I listen to podcasts while at my regular job, so I can at least listen to others talk about coding, front end development, javascript, node.js and other nerdy things while I perform the monkey operations at my current job.

Here's to the new year ( 2016 ) and all the learning that will take place.
